//Instructions to use the App
website URL for TMDB Movie Browser - https://movie-browser-3afb3.web.app/

1. Open the URL and a list of upcoming movies will load on your browser
2. Users can search for movies by using the search bar in the Header
3. Users can view Movie Details by clicking on the movie of their choice
4. User can navigate back to the List page from the Details page by using arrow back button, home button or browser back button

//Listing elements from the challenge that I have done well
1. Use of axios and requests.js file to improve scalability of the application.
2. Use of redux to avoid prop drilling and thus improving efficiency
3. Using react-spinners to render some UI while the API response is getting rendered on the screen
4. Responsive UI by using flex box with subtle hover actions and color scheming

//What I would do to improve my solution if I had 4 more hours
1. I would like to take up the time to learn more about Jest as I wasn't able to get my test setups done in time.
2. I would also like to take up more time to study the TMDB API as there is a lot of content on it's use on the internet and I am sure there are some very useful API endpoints that I could have used as well.
3. Explore Remix.js as I have not worked with it yet

//Feedback to improve the challenge
1. Including a wider range of colors or letting candidates pick their own color combinations.
